This allows you to focus solely on maintaining a strong economic base.\n- Focus on producing only Worker units. Workers are low-cost and can be used for basic attacks and resource gathering.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than attacking.\n- Deploy your defense at a close distance (distance = 1) from the base. This will create a tight perimeter of protection around your base.\n- Use your Worker units to defend your base and resources, ensuring that your economic operations are not disrupted.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units besides Workers.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is close (distance = 1).",
