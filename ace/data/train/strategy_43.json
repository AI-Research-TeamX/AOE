The high damage output of heavy units makes them effective in offensive operations.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy is aggressively oriented towards attacking.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except heavy units.\n- Do not delay the construction of barracks, as it is crucial for producing heavy units.\n- Do not plan for a defensive strategy, as the focus is on offensive maneuvers.\n- Avoid engaging in defensive operations or holding ground, as the strategy is to actively seek out and destroy enemy units.",
