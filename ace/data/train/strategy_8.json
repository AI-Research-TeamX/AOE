This single worker will focus on gathering resources efficiently.\n- Construct barracks as soon as you gather 5 resources to enable the production of worker units.\n- Focus on producing only worker units. Since the military strategy is centered around workers, no other units will be produced.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize offensive operations over defense.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units. This will help weaken the enemy's infrastructure and resource generation.\n- Send your workers to attack the enemy base and structures immediately upon creation, as your Military Feature is set to Worker.\n- Keep a steady stream of workers being produced to maintain pressure on the enemy.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other unit types except workers.\n- Do not prioritize defense, as the strategy is aggressive and focuses on attacking enemy buildings.\n- Avoid building any structures other than the barracks, as additional structures are not necessary for this strategy.\n- Do not wait to build up a large force before attacking; instead, send workers to attack as soon as they are available to keep the pressure on the enemy.",
