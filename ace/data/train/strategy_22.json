Although this limits your resource intake, it allows for a more focused approach.\n- Construct a barracks when you accumulate 10 resources. This will enable the production of heavy and worker units.\n- Focus on producing heavy and worker units exclusively. Heavy units provide strong offensive and defensive capabilities, while workers can help with resource gathering and minor defensive tasks.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over attack. Your strategy is to hold your ground and protect your base and resources.\n- Deploy your defense at a very far distance (distance = 4) from your base. This creates a buffer zone that can help intercept and delay enemy advances.\n- Use heavy units to form the core of your defensive perimeter, supported by workers for auxiliary tasks.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other unit types except heavy and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as your strategy is defensive.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is very far (distance = 4) to provide a buffer zone.",
