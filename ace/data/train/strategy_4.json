    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to ensure a steady flow of resources.\n- Construct a barracks once you have gathered 10 resources. This will enable the production of heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Focus on producing a mix of heavy, light, and worker units to create a balanced military force.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than attacking.\n- Deploy your defense at a far distance (distance = 3) from the base, creating a broader perimeter to protect your position.\n- Hold ground with your military units, using them to defend against potential enemy attacks rather than pursuing offensive operations.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is far (distance = 3).",
