    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth. This strategy relies more on defensive and strategic play rather than rapid resource accumulation.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 7. This timing allows for a balanced approach, ensuring you have enough resources to sustain the barracks and subsequent unit production.\n- Focus on producing only light and worker units. Light units provide a good balance between cost and damage, while workers can support both economic and military roles.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units. This aggressive strategy aims to dismantle the enemy's infrastructure to cripple their ability to produce more units and resources.\n- Send both light and worker units to attack. Utilize the speed of light units and the versatility of workers to effectively engage and destroy enemy buildings.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy focuses on aggressive play rather than holding ground.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified light and worker units.\n- Do not plan for a defensive perimeter, as the strategy is centered around offensive actions.\n- Avoid holding back units for defense; the goal is to maximize the pressure on the enemy's base and infrastructure.",
