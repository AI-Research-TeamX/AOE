    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to support ongoing economic growth.\n- Construct a barracks once resources exceed 7 to enable the production of heavy and worker units.\n- Focus on producing only heavy and worker units, with a priority on heavy units due to their higher damage output.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units. This approach helps to dismantle your opponent's infrastructure and limit their resource gathering and unit production capabilities.\n- Send both worker and heavy units to attack, leveraging the synergy between the heavy units' high damage and the worker units' mobility and support roles.\n- Do not plan for a designated defense area, as the strategy is offensive and focuses on taking down the enemy base and structures.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except heavy and worker units.\n- Do not waste resources on building defenses or holding ground; the primary focus is on offensive operations.\n- Avoid engaging in prolonged skirmishes with enemy units if they do not threaten your primary objective of attacking buildings.",
