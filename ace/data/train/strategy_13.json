Focus on using the base to produce workers exclusively.\n- Continuously produce workers as your main unit type to ensure a steady stream of units for both economic and military purposes.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units, as the Aggression Feature is set to True and the Attack Feature focuses on buildings.\n- Send all produced workers to attack enemy buildings, especially targeting the base or any structures that the enemy is trying to build.\n- Maintain a focus on offensive operations and do not plan for a designated defense area, as the Defense Feature is None.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units, such as Light, Heavy, or Ranged units, as these require the construction of a barracks.\n- Do not build a barracks, as it is unnecessary given the current military strategy.\n- Avoid defensive maneuvers or setting up a defensive perimeter; the strategy is to be continuously aggressive and target enemy structures.\n- Do not waste resources on building unnecessary structures or units that do not contribute to the offensive strategy.",
