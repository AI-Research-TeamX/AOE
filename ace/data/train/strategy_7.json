    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to ensure a steady flow of resources.\n- Construct barracks once you have gathered 9 resources. This will allow you to diversify your military units.\n- Focus on producing a combination of ranged, light, and worker units. This mix provides both offensive and defensive capabilities.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense over attacking.\n- Deploy your defense at a distance of 3 from the base. This provides a good balance between protecting your base and not leaving your units too exposed.\n- Use your ranged units to support defense by attacking from a distance, while light units can quickly respond to threats.\n- Workers can assist in both defense and resource gathering, ensuring that your economy remains strong and you have the resources to continue producing units.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged, light, and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy leans towards defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is at a distance of 3.\n- Do not neglect resource harvesting, as maintaining a strong economy is crucial for sustaining your defense and production capabilities.",
