Light units will serve as your main combat force, while workers can assist in both economic and military roles.\n- Adopt an aggressive stance by prioritizing attacks on enemy units, including workers, heavy, light, and ranged units.\n- Send both light and worker units to attack, utilizing the speed and agility of light units and the versatility of workers to effectively engage the enemy.\n- Do not plan for a specific defense area, as the strategy is primarily offensive.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except light and worker units.\n- Do not hold back from attacking; the strategy is to be aggressive and focus on taking out enemy units.\n- Avoid building a fixed defense perimeter; instead, use your units to actively seek out and engage the enemy.",
