    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to support economic growth, ensuring a steady income of resources.\n- Construct a barracks once resources exceed 7 to enable the production of heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Focus on a balanced military composition by producing heavy, light, and worker units. This mix provides a versatile force capable of handling various threats and scenarios.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense and holding ground over offensive actions.\n- Deploy your defense at a medium-to-far distance (distance = 3) from the base, creating a robust perimeter to protect your position and resources.\n- Use heavy units for their strong attack power, light units for their speed and flexibility, and workers for basic defense and resource gathering.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any units other than the specified heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Avoid initiating attacks or prioritizing offensive operations, as the strategy focuses on defense.\n- Do not place your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is at a distance of 3, providing a balanced defense.\n- Avoid unnecessary movements that could weaken your defensive position.",
