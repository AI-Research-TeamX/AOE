    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to steadily build up resources. The single worker will ensure a continuous flow of resources, though at a slower rate compared to two workers.\n- Construct a barracks once resources exceed 10. This will enable you to produce a mix of ranged and worker units.\n- Focus on producing only ranged and worker units. The combination of ranged units for their attack range and workers for their versatility will provide a balanced offensive force.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings. This will help dismantle the enemy's military capabilities and reduce the threat to your own base.\n- Send both workers and ranged units to attack the enemy, focusing on eliminating their units first. This will weaken their ability to launch counterattacks or defend their base.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy is focused on aggressive play.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged and worker units.\n- Do not allocate resources towards building defensive structures or deploying units for defense.\n- Avoid attacking buildings until the enemy units are neutralized, as your primary target is to weaken their offensive capabilities.\n- Do not build a barracks prematurely; wait until you have at least 10 resources to ensure you have enough to start producing units immediately after construction.",
