Heavy units provide strong offensive capabilities, while light units add versatility, and workers support the economy and can assist in minor skirmishes.\n- Adopt an aggressive playstyle by prioritizing the attack on enemy units (such as workers, heavy, light, and ranged units) over buildings.\n- Send a combination of heavy, light, and worker units to attack the enemy, leveraging the strengths of each unit type for effective combat.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy focuses on maintaining pressure on the enemy and not on passive defense.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Do not prioritize attacking buildings over enemy units.\n- Do not establish a defensive perimeter, as the strategy emphasizes aggressive play.\n- Avoid settling into a defensive stance; keep the pressure on the enemy to disrupt their economy and military buildup.",
