    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to ensure a steady flow of resources.\n- Construct a barracks once you have gathered 8 resources, which will allow you to produce a variety of units.\n- Focus on producing a balanced military force consisting of ranged, light, and worker units. This combination provides both offensive and defensive capabilities.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, your primary goal is to defend your position rather than aggressively attack the enemy.\n- Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 2) from the base. This will create a buffer zone that helps protect your base and resources.\n- Use your ranged units to engage enemies from a safe distance, while light units can provide additional firepower and mobility. Workers can support by repairing or rebuilding any damaged structures.\n- Maintain a strong defensive perimeter to prevent enemy units from advancing too close to your base.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified ranged, light, and worker units.\n- Do not initiate aggressive attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy focuses on defense.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium (distance = 2).\n- Do not neglect the importance of resource management; ensure you have enough resources to support the production of the necessary units.",
