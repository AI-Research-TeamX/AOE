    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate a single worker for mineral harvesting to gradually build up your resources.\n- Construct a barracks once you gather 6 resources, which will enable the production of ranged and worker units.\n- Focus on producing a combination of ranged and worker units. Prioritize the production of ranged units for their attack capabilities and worker units for resource gathering and flexible support roles.\n- Given the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize attacking enemy buildings over units to disrupt their economy and limit their ability to produce threats.\n- Use both types of units (ranged and worker) in your offensive operations. Ranged units will provide damage from a distance, while workers can help in basic attacks and provide additional resources through harvesting captured or neutral mineral fields.\n- Do not establish a dedicated defensive perimeter, as the strategy is geared towards aggressive play, focusing on proactive attacks rather than holding ground.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units, such as Heavy or Light units.\n- Avoid setting up a defensive perimeter, as the focus is on offense.\n- Refrain from building more than one worker for initial resource gathering, as the strategy aims to build up resources more slowly but steadily.",
