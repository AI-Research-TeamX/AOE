Instead, focus on aggressive actions to disrupt and overpower the enemy.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified ranged units.\n- Do not build a defensive perimeter or hold ground; the strategy is to be aggressive and proactive in attacks.\n- Avoid unnecessary defensive maneuvers and focus on leveraging the ranged attack to gain an advantage.",
