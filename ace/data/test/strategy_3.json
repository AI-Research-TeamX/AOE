    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to support economic growth. This slower economic development will allow for a more focused and efficient use of resources.\n- Construct barracks once resources exceed 9. This delayed construction will ensure that you have enough resources to build and maintain your military units effectively.\n- Focus on producing only worker units. Despite the lack of advanced military units, a large number of workers can be effective in swarming and overwhelming the enemy, especially in early-game confrontations.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings. Since workers are relatively weak, focusing on taking out the enemy's units will reduce the threat to your base and resources.\n- Send all your workers to attack the enemy units. This will maximize your offensive power, even though each worker only deals 1 damage.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except workers.\n- Do not delay attacking until you have a large number of units; instead, maintain a continuous pressure on the enemy with whatever workers you have.\n- Avoid building a defense perimeter, as the strategy is focused on offensive play.",
