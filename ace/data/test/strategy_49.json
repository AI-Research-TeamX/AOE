The Heavy units provide substantial damage to enemy buildings, while Workers can support the economy and assist in attacks.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize aggressive play. Focus on attacking enemy buildings to disrupt their economy and production capabilities.\n- Send both Heavy units and Workers to attack enemy structures. The Heavy units will deal significant damage, while the Workers can provide additional damage and help in overwhelming enemy defenses.\n- Do not plan a defensive perimeter, as the strategy is focused on offensive operations.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except Heavy and Worker.\n- Do not build additional barracks or focus on a defensive strategy.\n- Avoid sending units to defend your base; instead, use them to attack enemy buildings and units.\n- Do not hesitate to engage the enemy early and often, as the strategy is designed for aggressive play.",
