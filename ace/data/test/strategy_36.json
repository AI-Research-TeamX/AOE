Use workers to support and assist in defense when necessary.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other unit types except heavy and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy is defensive.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close to the base, as the ideal perimeter is far (distance = 3).",
