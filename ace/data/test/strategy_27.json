    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate one worker for mineral harvesting to support your economic needs. This will allow you to gather resources efficiently while leaving an option to use the base to produce additional units if necessary.\n- Build barracks as soon as you have gathered 6 resources. This will enable you to produce both ranged and worker units, which are essential for your aggressive strategy.\n- Focus on producing ranged and worker units. The ranged units will provide long-distance support, while the workers can assist in attacks and repair any necessary structures.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to True, prioritize attacking enemy units over buildings. This will help in weakening the enemy\u2019s military presence and potentially disrupt their resource gathering.\n- Send both workers and ranged units to attack the enemy. Utilize the ranged units' ability to attack from a distance to keep your units safe while the workers can engage in close combat or assist in repairs.\n- Omit designated defense areas, as the strategy focuses on aggressive play and active engagement with the enemy.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any other types of units except the specified ranged and worker units.\n- Do not build barracks before you have 6 resources, as this could slow down your economic growth and unit production.\n- Do not prioritize defensive tactics, as the strategy is designed for aggressive play.\n- Avoid holding ground or setting up a defensive perimeter, as the goal is to actively engage and disrupt the enemy.",
