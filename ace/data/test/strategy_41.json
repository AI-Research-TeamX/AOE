    "description": "## Description\nYou should:\n- Allocate two workers for mineral harvesting to sustain economic development and ensure a steady supply of resources.\n- Construct a barracks as soon as you gather 6 resources to enable the production of heavy and worker units.\n- Focus on producing only heavy and worker units. Heavy units will provide significant attack power, while workers can help with both harvesting and support.\n- Since the Aggression Feature is set to False, prioritize defense rather than initiating aggressive actions.\n- Deploy your defense at a medium distance (distance = 2) from the base. This will allow you to create a balanced perimeter of protection around your position.\n- Utilize heavy units to defend against approaching enemy units and structures, and deploy workers to assist in this defense and to continue resource gathering.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not produce any unit types other than the specified heavy and worker units.\n- Do not initiate attacks or prioritize offensive operations, as the strategy is defensive.\n- Avoid placing your defense too close or too far from the base, as the ideal perimeter is medium (distance = 2).",
