More units are better.\n- Only produce heavy, light, and worker units.\n- Prioritize attacking enemy bases first, followed by barracks, and then workers.\n- Use a combination of heavy and light units for their different strengths in combat, and workers to support and potentially repair.\n- Send both heavy, light, and worker units to attack, rather than just using a single type.\n- Omit designated defense areas; focus on offensive actions.\n\nYou should not:\n- Do not build additional barracks.\n- Do not produce any other units.\n- Do not plan deploy tasks.\n- Do not engage in defensive strategies. Focus on attacking.",
